# jwt-token-decrypter
JWT Token Decrypt Tool

Key Features
Header Analysis: Displays the algorithm (alg) and token type (typ)
Payload Inspection: Shows all claims including standard (iss, exp, sub) and custom data
Signature Status: Indicates whether verification is possible (requires secret/key)
Format Validation: Checks if the token follows the correct JWT structure
Security Considerations
While this tool helps examine JWT contents, remember:

Never share sensitive production tokens
JWTs in URLs may be logged in browser history
Decoding doesn't verify token authenticity
Always validate tokens in your production environment
